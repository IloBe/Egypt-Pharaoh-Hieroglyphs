# Egypt_Pharao_Hieroglyphs
Python Application informs about most important egypt pharao names of BC dynasties.

Note:<br>
Main reason implementing this web application is to learn functionalities and concepts of [Plotly-Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/). As I am not an archaeologist, but a data scientist, I do not guarantee the correctness and completeness of the pharaoh name list. Notes on errors and necessary corrections are therefore expressly welcome.

The BC dates from the 1st dynasty up to the late period given are approximate. The information is based on [Quirk, 2010, Who are the Pharaos?](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIB766) published by The British Museum.<br>
