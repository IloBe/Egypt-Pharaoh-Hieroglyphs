# Egypt_Pharao_Hieroglyphs
Python Application informs about most important egypt pharao names of BC dynasties.

Note:<br>
Main reason implementing this web application is to learn functionalities and concepts of [Plotly-Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/). As I am not an archaeologist, but a data scientist, I do not guarantee the correctness and completeness of the pharaoh name list. Notes on errors and necessary corrections are therefore expressly welcome.

## Data
Regarding the data used for analysis, the BC dates from the 1st dynasty up to the late period given are approximate. The information is based on [Stephen Quirke, 2010, Who are the Pharaos?](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIB766) published by The British Museum. Another source of more detailed listed pharaoh names is given via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharaohs), but how much such article is reviewed and accepted by domain experts is unknown.<br> 
So, regarding the kings list of the web application, the .csv data source stored in the data directory is created with primary focus on the Quirke information, but predynastic rulers before dynasty 1 and the greek and roman period after the late period are ignored yet.<br>

Regarding the pharaoh names: Associated hieroglyphs with its transliterations are created with the open source hieroglyph editor [JSesh](https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/) from Serge Rosmorduc. A general introduction reading egyptian hieroglyphs delivers the step-by-step guide of [Mark Collier and Bill Manley](https://www.britishmuseumshoponline.org/how-to-read-egyptian-hieroglyphs-a-step-by-step-guide-to-teach-yourself.html) from The British Museum.

### The Five Names of Pharao
Names are important to establish identity, particularly for a king. In general, egyptian pharaohs received five names to emphasise their power compared to ordinary people. They got the first one at birth and four additional ones at accession. The royal names titles are in classical order:
- **Horus** - rectangular box with horus called serech and a horus falcon in front of it, has been the only framed royal name up to the third dynasty
- **He of the Two Ladies** - starts with hieroglyphs for upper- and lower-egypt, the falcon Nechbet and the cobra Wadjet
- **(Horus of) Gold** - starts with horus falcon sitting on the hieroglyph sign for gold
- **He of the Sedge and Bee** - throne name in general as cartouche, used from the fourth dynasty on
- **Son of Ra** - birth name of the king, shown as cartouche as well, can be modified by an added epithet given in parenthesis
