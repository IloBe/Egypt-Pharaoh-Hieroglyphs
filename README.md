# Egypt_Pharao_Hieroglyphs
Python Application informs about most important egypt pharao names of the BC dynasties.

Note:<br>
main reason implementing this web application is to learn functionalities and concepts of Plotly-Dash. As I am not an archaeologist, but a data scientist, I do not guarantee the correctness and completeness of the pharaoh name list. The BC dates from the 1st Dynasty to the last given are approximate. The information is based on [Quirk, 2010, Who are the Pharaos?]
(https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIB766). Notes on errors and necessary corrections are therefore expressly welcome.
