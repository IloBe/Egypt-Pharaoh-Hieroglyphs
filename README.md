# Egypt_Pharao_Hieroglyphs
Python Application informs about most important egypt pharao names of BC dynasties.

Note:<br>
Main reason implementing this web application is to learn functionalities and concepts of [Plotly-Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/). As I am not an archaeologist, but a data scientist, I do not guarantee the correctness and completeness of the pharaoh name list. Notes on errors and necessary corrections are therefore expressly welcome.

The BC dates from the 1st dynasty up to the late period given are approximate. The information is based on [Stephen Quirke, 2010, Who are the Pharaos?](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIB766) published by The British Museum. Another source of more detailed listed pharaoh names is given via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharaohs), but how much such article is reviewed and accepted by domain experts is unknown.<br> 
So, regarding the kings list of the web application, the .csv data source stored in the data directory is created with primary focus on the Quirke information, but predynastic rulers before dynasty 1 and the greek and roman period after the late period are ignored.<br>

Regarding the pPharao names: Associated hieroglyphs with its transliterations are created with the open source hieroglyph editor [JSesh](https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/) from Serge Rosmorduc.
